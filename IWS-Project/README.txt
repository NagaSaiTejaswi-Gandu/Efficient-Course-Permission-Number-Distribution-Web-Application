"Permission number distribution system"
PNDS is a website where professors and students can login using their UML credentials and setup and communicate permission numbers.

How it works:
Professors can use their UML credentials to log in, create classes, and save permission numbers for the classes on the website. They can specify the minimum requirements for student permission number requests in any of their classes. After logging in, students can view these requirements and apply. The professor has a dashboard with the requests for each class, where he can easily and quickly approve or deny these requests, in which case the website automatically emails the students.
The website logs when and who received each permission number, as well as how many permission numbers the professor may have. This inventory is tracked and statistics are provided.
